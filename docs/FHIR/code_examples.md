# find all FHIR-based claims auto-adjudication engine companies

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

1. **Companies using RAG on FHIR platform for auto-adjudication:**
   - Edenlab: Built an auto-adjudication engine for a large TPA in Hong Kong to automate claims processing for major health insurance companies. This system ensures data consistency and accuracy using FHIR[[1](https://edenlab.io/case/fhir-based-claims-auto-adjudication-engine)][[3](https://kodjin.com/blog/auto-adjudication-of-claims-system-case)].

2. **Companies with FHIR only (no RAG platform):**
   - The search results did not specify any companies with FHIR-only platforms without RAG for claims auto-adjudication. Further research may be needed to identify such companies.

3. **Companies with automatic insurance claim engines without FHIR:**
   - Plexis Health: Provides a rules-based engine to automate workflows for claims adjudication, benefit administration, enrollments, eligibilities, and premium billing, but there's no mention of FHIR integration[[6](https://www.plexishealth.com/claims-adjudication-software/)].
